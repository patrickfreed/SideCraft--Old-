    <!--
    CharacterRegions control what letters are available in the font.  Every
    character from Start to End will be built and made available for drawing. The
    default range is from 32 to 127, which is the basic Latin character set. The
    characters are ordered according to the Unicode standard.
         Change these regions to make more or fewer letters available. To save
    graphics memory and decrease build time, try to use as few letters as possible.
    You can specify additional regions by adding more <CharacterRegion> tags.
    Alternatively, you can use a custom processor to add specific characters. See
    the documentation for more information.
